I am a Quality Professional, trying to maintain EASY Batch/Lot number traceability by maintaining one lot number for the entire lifecycle of our products.  Microsoft Dynamics AX allows the improper practice of changing a batch number any time a Part Number changes. Even though it may be possible to track this Batch and Part Number back to the original manufactured lot, one must have access to AX and also know the procedure for tacking this changed batch number.  I am looking for help from experts who also believe this is a very bad manufacturing process that increases risk, and unnecessary expense and labor to maintain tracability thoughout the lifecycle of our product.  FYI: We make products for Aviation, Defense, Automotive, and Medical Equipment. Thank you very much!
